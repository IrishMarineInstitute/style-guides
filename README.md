# Style Guides

A set of guides on how we work, covering a number of (meta)data topics, eveloped by data teams at the Marine Institute, Ireland. These style guides have been developed to help provide consistency around data tools and analytics. Workflows and best practices give suggestions to help aid collaboration, both internally to the Marine Institute and with other organisations, and to give maximum clarity for data users.

Inspired by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy's Space Telescope Science Institute [Style Guides](https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides).

There are currently sytle guides [in development] for:
  - Jupyter notebooks
 
 In addition, there are the following guides [are being developed] around best practices and workflows:
   - Dataset naming
   - Dataset abstracts
   - Attributes for dataset annotation in Erddap
